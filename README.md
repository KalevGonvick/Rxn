# Rxn Engine
Both a failure and learning experience.

This project had 3 goals:

- Learn C++
- Learn DX12
- Learn WIN32 APIs

I definitely learned a lot during the development of this project. 

I may return in the future, but not without a large rebuild of some of the major components, or just remake the project in rust or something.
