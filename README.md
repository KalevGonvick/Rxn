# Rxn Engine
Both a failure and learning experience.

This project had 3 goals:

- Learn C++
- Learn DX12
- Learn WIN32 APIs

I definitely learned a lot during the development of this project. Most of which relates to C++ and manageing C++ projects.

If I were to do this again:

- Plan out modules with more clearly defined responsibilities.
- Use C++ modules over headers.
- Invest more time into unit testing.
- Roadmap to keep goals clear, especially so I can remember what I was actually doing in between gaps of development.

I may return in the future, but maybe I could just remake this in rust :)
